# **Constraints**

Every project operates within a unique set of boundaries that define what is possible,
practical, and achievable. These constraints help shape the project’s scope, set
expectations, and guide decision-making throughout its lifecycle. By understanding
and defining these limitations early, we can establish a clear framework for what
the project can and cannot include.

Constraints are not just obstacles; they can also be tools for innovation. When
used constructively, they push us to think critically and find creative solutions
within the defined boundaries. This document outlines both **external factors**
(which we cannot control) and **internal constraints** (both involuntary and voluntary)
that influence our approach. Together, these considerations will help us craft a
realistic and impactful project that meets its objectives efficiently and effectively.

## **External Constraints** 🚧

External constraints are limitations imposed by factors outside the team’s direct
control. These constraints shape the scope, timeline, and feasibility of the project,
requiring careful planning and adaptability. Key external constraints include:

- **Internet Connectivity** 🌐: Unreliable or slow internet access can disrupt
- communication, research, and collaborative workflows, affecting project progress.
- **Power Outages** ⚡: Unpredictable power cuts can interrupt work, delay progress,
- and impact productivity, especially in locations without backup power.
- **Competing Workload** 📚: Team members juggling other responsibilities, such
as additional jobs or unrelated projects, can reduce the time and focus dedicated
to the current project.
- **Resource Availability** 🔧: Limited access to external tools, materials, or
technologies required for the project can create bottlenecks.

## **Internal Constraints: Involuntary** 🔒

Internal involuntary constraints arise from unavoidable limitations within the team
or organization. These constraints are inherent and require careful management to
ensure they do not hinder project success. Key involuntary constraints include:

- **Time Availability** ⏳: Team members may have limited hours to dedicate to the
project due to fixed schedules, personal commitments, or overlapping responsibilities.
- **Varied Skill Sets** 🛠️: Differences in expertise or gaps in knowledge within
the team can create dependencies, requiring additional training or external support
to complete certain tasks.
- **Other Priorities** 🔄: Internal competing priorities, such as involvement in
other projects, deadlines, or other responsibilities, can reduce the focus and
effort allocated to this project.

Recognizing these constraints helps the team set realistic goals, plan effectively,
and address challenges proactively to maintain productivity.

## **Internal Constraints: Voluntary** 💡

Voluntary internal constraints are self-imposed limitations set by the team to guide
the project and ensure quality, efficiency, and alignment with goals. These constraints
reflect deliberate decisions made to improve outcomes and maintain focus. Key voluntary
constraints include:

- **Time Management Rules** 🕒: Allocating specific working hours or limiting overtime
to maintain work-life balance and prevent burnout.
- **Skill Development Focus** 📈: Prioritizing tasks that align with team members’
learning goals or strengths to foster growth while ensuring quality output.
- **Project Scope Definition** 🎯: Deliberately narrowing the scope to focus on essential
features and deliverables, avoiding unnecessary complexity or scope creep.
- **Adherence to Standards** 📑: Committing to practices like clean coding, thorough
documentation, and consistent testing, as well as going through the code review checklist
to ensure quality and consistency throughout the project.

These constraints are designed to create a structured and sustainable workflow, enabling
the team to deliver a high-quality project while fostering creativity and collaboration.

## **Call to Action** 🚀

We encourage everyone to continuously evaluate the constraints that affect their
work and communicate any challenges or solutions as they arise. If you encounter
any
constraints that impact your ability to deliver, collaborate with the team to develop
a plan and overcome them and free to create an issue. Together, we can navigate
these challenges and ensure
the success of the project!
