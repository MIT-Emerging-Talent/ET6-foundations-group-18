## Communication Channels

Details about how often we will communicate and what to discuss on each platform:

- **Issues**:  
  Use GitHub Issues to document and discuss tasks. Assign yourself to an issue
  when you begin a task and provide updates regularly. Add clear labels
  (e.g., "Bug," "Feature," "Question") for better organization.

- **Pull Requests**:  
  When a task is completed, create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub. Ensure your
  PR includes a descriptive title and summary of changes.
  
- **Slack/WhatsApp**:  
  These platforms will be our primary channels for real-time communication.
  Use them to:
  - Share quick updates.
  - Clarify immediate questions.
  - Notify members of any schedule or plan changes.

- **Video Meetings**:  
  Regular video meetings will take place on **Google Meet**.
  The meeting link will be shared on Slack or WhatsApp at least 24 hours in advance.
   Use meetings for:
  - Planning next steps.
  - Discussing blockers or complex issues.
  - Reviewing progress and setting goals.
